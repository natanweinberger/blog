# About me

Hi, I'm Natan. This site has a little about me, my projects and some guides.

### Work

- Currently, I'm a staff data engineer at Shopify.

- Before that, I worked as technical lead at SSENSE.

- I've also worked for the Philadelphia Phillies, where I worked on data infrastructure, data modelling and a whole bunch of other things.

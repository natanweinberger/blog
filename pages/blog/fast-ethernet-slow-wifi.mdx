# Fast Ethernet, Slow Wi-Fi

I recently stayed at a hotel where the Wi-Fi connection was much slower than the Ethernet.

The ethernet connection is way better, but it only works with my laptop. How can I share the stronger Ethernet connection with my phone and Chromecast?

## Sharing the Ethernet connection via Bluetooth

This was my first instinct. It works, but it's super slow.

Depending on the version of Bluetooth on your devices, the data transfer rate might be capped at [no more than a few Mbit/s](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2022-transmission-rate-vs-bandwidth-in-bluetooth-technology).

## Broadcasting a Wi-Fi network

It turns out that Macs can broadcast their own Wi-Fi network.

The catch is that the Wi-Fi card can only do one thing at a time. If it's connected to a Wi-Fi network, it can't simultaneously broadcast a new signal for other devices to connect to.

However, since we're plugged into Ethernet, we're not using the Wi-Fi card. We can use it to broadcast a new network for other devices to connect to.

## Creating a wireless network

To do so, head to `System Preferences > Sharing` and click on `Internet Sharing` (but don't enable it just yet).

You'll see an dropdown menu where you can choose to share your connection from a LAN, your Ethernet connection.

In my case, the option is labeled `Belkin USB-C LAN`.

Next, select the option to share to computers using Wi-Fi.

Lastly, click on `Wi-Fi Options` and customize the new network details.

Then, check the box next to `Internet Sharing` on the left-hand menu. The Internet Sharing options will gray out and your Mac will start broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal that your other devices can connect to.

From other devices, the new network is available to connect to.

## Casting Perks

Typically, hotel networks aren't friendly with casting devices, but streaming devices like Chromecast or Apple TV have no issues with the network broadcast from the Mac.
